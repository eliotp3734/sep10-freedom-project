## Part B My ideas for the future
I wrote about part A in the last blog with figuring out what technology was already around helping in the Architecture field. Now part B is brainstorming my new ideas for what could help. My first idea was the idea I am sticking with now. My idea was to make a VR (virtual reality) software called Archistructure that could be used to create 3d models but also to view them in front of you to make it feel more real. You would be able to view 3d models to scale, and if you made a bigger project, for example an apartment, you could go into it to see what it would look like at an open house or to a buyer. This could be very helpful for architects and interior designers who want to see if their design works. Some more details to it I came up with include transferable data via SD card, multiple supported file types, being able to transfer the app from VR to a more lightweight compact pair of glasses, and being able to use the app on VR and computer to make adjustments. But my final addition to this app is what I think would be the most helpful. Because you are viewing a 3d model the app could decompose your model to an engineer or builders standpoint to help give instructions on how to build the house. For example, you could set the work plan down in the app then it could tell you what the first steps are and how to build it. It would outline the next steps you would have to do similar to lego instructions with a ghost shape in place of what you need to do. This would be very beneficial to the Architect and Construction industry because it would mean you are able to see your art before spending tons of money on it. And with Archistructure costing $449.99 and cross platform compatibility, I believe that my app can change the industry.
