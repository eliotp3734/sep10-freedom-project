## Part B My ideas for the future
I wrote about part A in the last blog with figuring out what technology was already around helping in the Arcitecture feild. Now part B is brain storming my new ideas for what could help. My first idea was the idea I am sticking with now. My idea was to make a VR (virtual reality) software that could be used to create 3d models but also to view them infront of you to make it feel more real. You would be able to view 3d models to scale, and if you made a bigger project, for example an apartment, you could go into it to see what it would look like at an open house or to a buyer. This could be very helpful for architects and interior designers who want to see if there design works. Some more details to it I came up with include transferable data via SD card, multipule supported file types, being able to transfer the app from VR to a more lightweight compact pair of glasses, and being able to use the app on VR and computer to make adjustments.
