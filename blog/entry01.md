### Context
In unit one we choose a topic for our freedom project.

We also started reviewing  HTML and Markdown basics as they are skills we can use throughout the year and the project.
 
### Lesson Summary
Here are some important notes to remember:

HTML and Markdown Basics
* Text sizes
  * To change the text sizes in HTML you need to put <h_> tags before and after where _ is how big you want the text to be (1 being the largest text size and 5 being the smallest.)
  * To change the text sizes in Markdown you simply add hashtags before the line of text. (1 hashtag being the largest text size and 5 being the smallest.)
* Images
  * To insert images in HTML you download an image into your main branch then use <img src=">. Inside the quotes you put the downloaded image name/url.
  * To insert images in Markdown you use ! [alt text] (filename)
* Links
  * To insert links in HTML you use <a href=""></a>
  * To insert links in Markdown you use [display text] (linkurl)
* Paragraphs
  * To write text in paragraph in HTML you use <p> tags before and after the text you want to uses
  * To write text in paragraph form in Markdown you simply just write the text
* Italics and Bold
  * To change the text to italics or bold in HTML you have to change the style.css file
  * To change the text to italics or bold Markdown you simply put astriscks before an after words (1 astrick for italic, 2 for bold, and 3 for both)
