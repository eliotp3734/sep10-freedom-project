## Name: Eliot Paster
## Course: SEP10
## Period: 7
## Concept: HTML and Markdown basics

### Context
In unit one we choose a topic for our freedom project. For my project I chose architecture as it is something I have found intrest in the past few years and someting I may consider for a career later in life. We also started reviewing  HTML and Markdown basics as they are skills we can use throughout the year and the project.
 
### Lesson Summary
Here are some important notes to remember:

HTML and Markdown Basics
* Text sizes
  * To change the text sizes in HTML you need to put <h_> tags before and after where _ is how big you want the text to be (1 being the largest text size and 5 being the smallest.)
  * To change the text sizes in Markdown you simply add hashtags before the line of text. (1 hashtag being the largest text size and 5 being the smallest.)
* Images
  * To insert images in HTML you download an image into your main branch then use <img src=">. Inside the quotes you put the downloaded image name/url.
  * To insert images in Markdown you use ! [alt text] (filename)
* Links
  * To insert links in HTML you use <a href=""></a>
  * To insert links in Markdown you use [display text] (linkurl)
* Paragraphs
  * To write text in paragraph in HTML you use <p> tags before and after the text you want to uses
  * To write text in paragraph form in Markdown you simply just write the text
* Italics and Bold
  * To change the text to italics or bold in HTML you have to change the style.css file
  * To change the text to italics or bold Markdown you simply put astriscks before an after words (1 astrick for italic, 2 for bold, and 3 for both)

 ### Challenge 1

The first challenge I stumbled across was in the website we use for learning html called freecodecamp.com. There was a section called "Link to Internal Sections of a Page with Anchor Elements" In this section you had to create an internal link in a webpage that could lead you down to a different spot. This acted similar to a table of contents in a book. I was following the instructions clearly but I still could not figure out what the issue was. Here is my initial code:
Below is an example of an internal anchor link and its target element:

```html
<a href="footer">Footer</a>
...
<h2 id"#footer">Footer</h2>
```

<h4 id="example1">Correct internal Anchor</h4>

```html
<a href="#contacts-header">Contacts</a>
...
<h2 id="contacts-header">Contacts</h2>
```
The mistake I made was where I placed the hashtag. The location of the hashtag is very important because where it is placed determines if I am naming a place that does not exist #footer or if I am creating a real place in the code #footer.

### Challenge 2
The second challenge I faced was while writing this blog entry. This blog entry is my first real experience using github as unit one also introduced websites I will be using through highschool. I learned many things about adding code pages, text pages, files, folders and more. I also learned how people can make templates I can used. What I did not learn was the point of the commit changes button in the top right of my code.

After tragically closing my laptop assuming github has autosave features I come back to github saturday night prepared to finish my first blog to realize none of my work has saved. Because of this I did reserch to find a solution and found a quote that stuck with me while writing the current blog.

`<h2>save early, save often</h2>`

I belive this quote stuck with me because with only 4 words it represented what I had lost and the time I had wasted but also the simple solution. When ever you think about your work and progress, commit changes.

### Challenge 3
The 3rd and final challenge I faced was small with a simple fix. I figured I might as well add this to the end of my first blog. I was working on my computer at home where I use a 65% keyboard. A 65% keyboard means that the keyboard is smaller then a large or normal keyboard. This can be good for smaller hands as it is more compact or also for people who play video games as it is easier to reach keys. This can be a downside for schoolwork though because you are missing some keys. A 65% keyboard looks similar to what is included in the image below.

If you take some time to review the keys not located on the keyboard you may notice that the backticks are missing. In Markdown you use backticks to include peices of code in other languages to show examples similar to how I did <a href="#example1">Here.</a> To solve this I switched to my school given computer knowing that I can use the backtick and complete the assignment with ease.

### Takeaways
* A major takeaway I have learned is that small things like the location of a hashtag or any small mistake in code can make huge effects in the outcome of your code. This can include it not working.
* Another takeaway I found is that Commiting changes is truely important and by not doing it often, hours of work can be lost.
* Last but not least there the working circumstances that you choose can have an effect on what you do. Some times changing location or device can make an impact on your outcome.
