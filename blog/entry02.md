### Research on Technology
In the previous blog I decided the topic I wanted to make my freedom project website on was Architecture. After figuring this out the next step for me was to do research on how technology is used in this feild. There is hardware, meaning physical technology then there is software meaning apps or digital technology. First I went looking for software. My first good search said **"Programs for architecture"** where I found a website about [the best architecture software.](https://monograph.com/blog/best-architecture-software) On this website I learned that there are many different types of applications that do different things but a popular type of app is 3d modeling softwares. Architects spend lots of time designing and creating the looks of buildings, some with physical materials and some digitally in 3d modeling software. More styles of apps include Rendering Software, PDF Reading/Editing Software, Business Suite Software for Architects, Accounting/Bookkeeping Software, File Hosting/Sharing Software, Communication Software and Image Editing Software. With all of the different roles needed many apps are used with more popular ones being Autocad, Autodesk - revit, Sketchup, Adobe software, Archicad and 3ds max. After learning a lot about the software I started to do research on how it helped. My second search was **"What do all of the basic architecture software help with?"** I learned that architecture software can help with 3 major things. 
Modifiability
* How can things be changed
* How can things be designed
Availability
* Simulations: Will this work?
* Do we have space
* Can engineers accommodate this?
* How much will this cost
Security
* Is this structurally stable?
* Is this a good location
* Is this safe
