## Research on Technology

### Software
In the previous blog I decided the topic I wanted to make my freedom project website on was Architecture. After figuring this out the next step for me was to do research on how technology is used in this feild. There is hardware, meaning physical technology then there is software meaning apps or digital technology. First I went looking for software. My first good search said **"Programs for architecture"** where I found a website about [the best architecture software.](https://monograph.com/blog/best-architecture-software) On this website I learned that there are many different types of applications that do different things but a popular type of app is 3d modeling softwares. Architects spend lots of time designing and creating the looks of buildings, some with physical materials and some digitally in 3d modeling software. More styles of apps include Rendering Software, PDF Reading/Editing Software, Business Suite Software for Architects, Accounting/Bookkeeping Software, File Hosting/Sharing Software, Communication Software and Image Editing Software. With all of the different roles needed many apps are used with more popular ones being Autocad, Autodesk - revit, Sketchup, Adobe software, Archicad and 3ds max. After learning a lot about the software I started to do research on how it helped. My second search was **"What do all of the basic architecture software help with?"** I learned that architecture software can help with 3 major things. 

#### Modifiability
* How can things be changed
* How can things be designed
#### Availability
* Simulations: Will this work?
* Do we have space
* Can engineers accommodate this?
* How much will this cost
#### Security
* Is this structurally stable?
* Is this a good location
* Is this safe

After learning what the software is and how it could be used I decided to move on to hardware.

### Hardware
My first search was very general. I looked up **"What sorts of hareware are used in architecture"** and learned that it can be sections or styles that are used when designing or building a house. An example I came up with is stairs as it is a physical thing put in houses or buildings. As I hadn't found any examples my next search was **"Examples of Hardware used in Architecture"** and I ended up at a website showcasing [Architecure functions used when designing in interior of homes.](fix.com.au/design-ideas/what-is-architectural-hardware-types-and-tips) From this website the website showcased things in homes I knew existed but didnt think of as architecture. For example I never thought of a door hinge as architecture but is it something in nearly every room making it more functional.

### EDP
I am currently on the second step of the Engineering design process where I do background research. All of the research I did today without even knowing it was helping contribute to my website and issue at hand because I am finding how other people use the technology and I am finding a way to make it better. The next step for me is to Specify the requirements which means to find what is important that can be improved upon.

### Skills

#### Googling
One important skill I have improved upon is googling because by doing reasearch I was able to find information to improve my knowlage of my topic. With millions of results popping up when I search the skill of googling helps out because I am able to skim through and find information good for me. When I was reaseaching I had a result that was not exactly what I needed but I was able to refrase what I said and I found much better answers.

### Next steps
My next step is for me to find a question to solve that is more specfic then the problem I found. There is not 1 big answer so I have to decide which route to create my website on.
